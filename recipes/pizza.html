<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup warm water (about 110째F / 45째C)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pepperoni slices (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for brushing)</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
    <li>Stir the mixture until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour as needed.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475째F (245째C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven.</li>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a round pizza crust about 12 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza pan or a parchment paper-lined pizza stone. Brush the crust with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, then add any additional toppings like pepperoni or basil.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, slice, and serve hot!</li>
  </ol>
